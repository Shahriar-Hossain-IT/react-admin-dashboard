# React Admin Dashboard Tutorial

This project is a dashboard application built using React, Material UI, Nivo Charts, Formik, Yup, FullCalendar, and Data Grid. It consists of Light and Dark Mode, 4 different Charts, 3 different Data Table Pages, FAQ Page, Form Page, and Calendar Integration.

## Why I code along this tutorial?

I code along this tutorial to learn how to use different third-party tools in React development. I had completed the Meta Frontend Course and wanted to enhance my knowledge of React by building a practical application that utilizes different tools and techniques.

Note: I have customized the project to be able to host it on GitHub Pages.

## What I learned from this tutorial

This tutorial helped me learn the following:

- How to use Material UI components to create a responsive design for web applications.
- How to use Nivo Charts to create different types of charts such as bar charts, pie charts, and line charts.
- How to use Data Grid to create a data table with pagination, sorting, and filtering capabilities.
- How to use Formik and Yup for form validation and handling user input.
- How to integrate FullCalendar to display events and schedule them.
- How to create a FAQ page using Material UI Accordion component.

## Project Structure
